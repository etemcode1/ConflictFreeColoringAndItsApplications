Here are five advanced code examples for the **Stable Marriage Problem**, focusing on **trust, honor**, and **reasonable care** in the matching process. Each example integrates ethical considerations to ensure respectful and caring pairings.

### 1. **Trust-Based Gale-Shapley Algorithm**

This implementation modifies the traditional Gale-Shapley algorithm to incorporate a **trust score** between partners, influencing the proposal decisions to prioritize matches based on trust.

```python
def trust_based_stable_marriage(men_preferences, women_preferences, trust_scores):
    free_men = list(men_preferences.keys())
    engaged = {}
    proposals = {man: [] for man in men_preferences}

    while free_men:
        man = free_men.pop(0)
        man_pref_list = men_preferences[man]
        # Sort preferences based on trust scores
        sorted_prefs = sorted(man_pref_list, key=lambda woman: trust_scores[(man, woman)], reverse=True)
        
        for woman in sorted_prefs:
            if woman not in proposals[man]:
                proposals[man].append(woman)

                if woman not in engaged:
                    engaged[woman] = man
                    break
                else:
                    current_man = engaged[woman]
                    if trust_scores[(man, woman)] > trust_scores[(current_man, woman)]:
                        free_men.append(current_man)
                        engaged[woman] = man
                        break

    return engaged

# Preferences and trust scores based on reasonable care
men_preferences = {
    'A': ['X', 'Y', 'Z'],
    'B': ['Y', 'X', 'Z'],
    'C': ['Y', 'Z', 'X']
}
women_preferences = {
    'X': ['B', 'A', 'C'],
    'Y': ['A', 'B', 'C'],
    'Z': ['A', 'B', 'C']
}

trust_scores = {
    ('A', 'X'): 0.9, ('A', 'Y'): 0.6, ('A', 'Z'): 0.8,
    ('B', 'X'): 0.7, ('B', 'Y'): 0.8, ('B', 'Z'): 0.5,
    ('C', 'X'): 0.6, ('C', 'Y'): 0.7, ('C', 'Z'): 0.9
}

# Output stable pairings based on trust
pairings = trust_based_stable_marriage(men_preferences, women_preferences, trust_scores)
print(f"Stable Marriage Pairings (Trust-Based): {pairings}")
```

### 2. **Honor-Based Matching with Preference Weighting**

This version incorporates an **honor score**, allowing individuals to weight their preferences based on how much they value honor in their partner choices.

```python
def honor_based_matching(men_preferences, women_preferences, honor_weights):
    free_men = list(men_preferences.keys())
    engaged = {}
    proposals = {man: [] for man in men_preferences}

    while free_men:
        man = free_men.pop(0)
        man_pref_list = men_preferences[man]
        # Adjust preferences based on honor weights
        adjusted_preferences = sorted(man_pref_list, key=lambda woman: honor_weights[(man, woman)], reverse=True)

        for woman in adjusted_preferences:
            if woman not in proposals[man]:
                proposals[man].append(woman)

                if woman not in engaged:
                    engaged[woman] = man
                    break
                else:
                    current_man = engaged[woman]
                    if honor_weights[(man, woman)] > honor_weights[(current_man, woman)]:
                        free_men.append(current_man)
                        engaged[woman] = man
                        break

    return engaged

# Create honor weights based on principles of honor and care
honor_weights = {
    ('A', 'X'): 0.8, ('A', 'Y'): 0.7, ('A', 'Z'): 0.9,
    ('B', 'X'): 0.9, ('B', 'Y'): 0.6, ('B', 'Z'): 0.4,
    ('C', 'X'): 0.5, ('C', 'Y'): 0.9, ('C', 'Z'): 0.8
}

# Output stable pairings based on honor-based adjustments
pairings = honor_based_matching(men_preferences, women_preferences, honor_weights)
print(f"Stable Marriage Pairings (Honor-Based): {pairings}")
```

### 3. **Reasonable Care in Proposal Acceptance**

In this version, individuals assess potential matches based on a **reasonable care threshold**, ensuring they only accept proposals from partners who meet their threshold of trust and care.

```python
def reasonable_care_matching(men_preferences, women_preferences, care_thresholds):
    free_men = list(men_preferences.keys())
    engaged = {}
    proposals = {man: [] for man in men_preferences}

    while free_men:
        man = free_men.pop(0)
        man_pref_list = men_preferences[man]

        for woman in man_pref_list:
            if woman not in proposals[man]:
                proposals[man].append(woman)

                if woman not in engaged:
                    engaged[woman] = man
                    break
                else:
                    current_man = engaged[woman]
                    # Only accept if the current match does not meet care threshold
                    if care_thresholds[(woman, man)] > care_thresholds[(woman, current_man)]:
                        free_men.append(current_man)
                        engaged[woman] = man
                        break

    return engaged

# Care thresholds indicating required trust and honor levels
care_thresholds = {
    ('X', 'A'): 0.6, ('X', 'B'): 0.8, ('X', 'C'): 0.7,
    ('Y', 'A'): 0.7, ('Y', 'B'): 0.5, ('Y', 'C'): 0.9,
    ('Z', 'A'): 0.8, ('Z', 'B'): 0.6, ('Z', 'C'): 0.9
}

# Output stable pairings considering reasonable care
pairings = reasonable_care_matching(men_preferences, women_preferences, care_thresholds)
print(f"Stable Marriage Pairings (Reasonable Care): {pairings}")
```

### 4. **Caring Match Algorithm with Emotional Compatibility**

This implementation introduces an emotional compatibility score that influences the matching process, ensuring that emotional care and support are considered.

```python
def emotional_compatibility_matching(men_preferences, women_preferences, emotional_scores):
    free_men = list(men_preferences.keys())
    engaged = {}
    proposals = {man: [] for man in men_preferences}

    while free_men:
        man = free_men.pop(0)
        man_pref_list = men_preferences[man]

        # Sort preferences based on emotional compatibility scores
        sorted_prefs = sorted(man_pref_list, key=lambda woman: emotional_scores[(man, woman)], reverse=True)

        for woman in sorted_prefs:
            if woman not in proposals[man]:
                proposals[man].append(woman)

                if woman not in engaged:
                    engaged[woman] = man
                    break
                else:
                    current_man = engaged[woman]
                    if emotional_scores[(man, woman)] > emotional_scores[(current_man, woman)]:
                        free_men.append(current_man)
                        engaged[woman] = man
                        break

    return engaged

# Emotional compatibility scores based on mutual respect and understanding
emotional_scores = {
    ('A', 'X'): 0.85, ('A', 'Y'): 0.75, ('A', 'Z'): 0.80,
    ('B', 'X'): 0.70, ('B', 'Y'): 0.85, ('B', 'Z'): 0.60,
    ('C', 'X'): 0.60, ('C', 'Y'): 0.65, ('C', 'Z'): 0.90
}

# Output stable pairings considering emotional compatibility
pairings = emotional_compatibility_matching(men_preferences, women_preferences, emotional_scores)
print(f"Stable Marriage Pairings (Emotional Compatibility): {pairings}")
```

### 5. **Holistic Matching Approach for Balanced Relationships**

This final implementation combines all the aforementioned elements—trust, honor, care, and emotional compatibility—into a single matching algorithm that balances all these factors for the best outcomes.

```python
def holistic_matching(men_preferences, women_preferences, trust_scores, honor_weights, emotional_scores, care_thresholds):
    free_men = list(men_preferences.keys())
    engaged = {}
    proposals = {man: [] for man in men_preferences}

    while free_men:
        man = free_men.pop(0)
        man_pref_list = men_preferences[man]

        # Score potential matches based on combined factors
        scored_preferences = sorted(
            man_pref_list,
            key=lambda woman: (
                trust_scores[(man, woman)] * 0.4 +
                honor_weights[(man, woman)] * 0.3 +
                emotional_scores[(man, woman)] * 0.3
            ),
            reverse=True
        )

        for woman in scored_preferences:
            if woman not in proposals[man]:
                proposals[man].append(woman)

                if woman not in engaged:
                    engaged[woman] = man
                    break
                else:
                    current_man = engaged[woman]
                    # Consider care threshold before switching
                    if care_thresholds[(woman, man)] > care_thresholds[(woman, current_man)]:
                        free_men.append(current_man)
                        engaged[woman] = man
                        break



    return engaged

# Combine all scores for holistic matching
pairings = holistic_matching(men_preferences, women_preferences, trust_scores, honor_weights, emotional_scores, care_thresholds)
print(f"Stable Marriage Pairings (Holistic Approach): {pairings}")
```

### Summary

These code examples explore various methods of integrating ethical considerations—such as trust, honor, and reasonable care—into the Stable Marriage Problem. Each algorithm reflects a different approach to matching individuals based on values that promote healthy and respectful relationships. You can further customize the parameters and scoring mechanisms to align with specific use cases or additional ethical dimensions.
